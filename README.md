The idea behind my clock was to make a representational object of a clock by relying on colors and animated pie charts.
At first, I was not sure about the direction I wanted to take, but after researching to see examples of others' clocks made in p5js,
I came across a clock made by Ikkchung (https://editor.p5js.org/lkkchung/sketches/SJBleiT9W).  After I took a moment to observe its
functionalities, I noticed that the three colors in the white circles represented the passing time (red = hours, green = minutes, blue = seconds).
I thought this code was unique, and it represented a clock very well despite that it did not looking like a literal clock.
I decided to repurpose Ikkchung's code into my own clock.  Instead of making my clock look like a target, I experimented with different sizes, positions, and colors.
As a result, my clock ended up looking far different from Ikkchung's.  After I saw the result, I thought it looked more interesting and visually engaging.
